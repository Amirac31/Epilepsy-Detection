# Epilepsy-Detection
ML Classification

In this project, I attempted to take 2216 EEG examinations with 667 entries each and try to classify whether or not they indicate the existence of epilepsy in the patient who went through that examination. 

* This work contains explanatory data analysis and visualization
* The Training of 3 different types of predictive models
* Evaluation of the models' performances and how they could be improved upon while improving results and making predictions more efficient.

ENJOY!
